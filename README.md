# Wide-bandwidth electrographic characterisation of seizures in rat models of epilepsy using graphene micro-transistors
### UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology – MSc Clinical Neuroscience

## Thesis Statement
In this thesis, I demonstrate the value of incorporating infraslow frequency activity (< 0.1 Hz) in seizure onset zone (SOZ) localisation with two rat models of chronic epilepsy (kainic acid and tetanus toxin), and another rat model of acute seizure (picrotoxin); and demonstrate the ability of two-generations of graphene solution-gated field-effect transistors (gSGFETs) in acquiring wide-bandwidth electrophysiological recordings.
Key breakthroughs in this study include:
-	Application of state-of-the-art gSGFETs in chronic models of epilepsy with greater phenotypical overlap with clinical presentations of temporal lobe epilepsy (kainic acid model), and occipital cortical epilepsy (tetanus toxin model). The use of chronic models represents a key step in elevating gSGFETs from proof-of-concept chemoconvulsant studies in head-fixed mice, by demonstrating value in both epilepsy research and clinical applications.
-	Association of spatial-coupling between active (pre-ictal) DC-shift and high-gamma power immediately preceding seizure onset, where channels demonstrating both greatest DC-shift amplitude and highest high-gamma power may lead to interictal prediction models of the SOZ with higher specificity.

(a) Graphene micro‐transistors can be arranged in either surface grids for epicortical recordings (right) or probes for intracortical recordings (left). (b) Schematic cross‐section of a graphene micro‐transistor showing the driving voltage (Vds) and the operation point selector voltage (Vgs). Drain‐source current fluctuations (Ids) can then be converted to voltage using a “transfer curve” (Ids‐Vgs curve). Figure adapted from Wykes et al., 2022.
