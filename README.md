# Wide-bandwidth electrographic characterisation of seizures in rat models of epilepsy using graphene micro-transistors
### UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology – MSc Clinical Neuroscience

## Thesis Statement
In this thesis, I demonstrate the value of incorporating infraslow frequency activity (< 0.1 Hz) in seizure onset zone (SOZ) localisation with two rat models of chronic epilepsy (kainic acid and tetanus toxin), and another rat model of acute seizure (picrotoxin); and demonstrate the ability of two-generations of graphene solution-gated field-effect transistors (gSGFETs) in acquiring wide-bandwidth electrophysiological recordings.
Key breakthroughs in this study include:
-	Application of state-of-the-art gSGFETs in chronic models of epilepsy with greater phenotypical overlap with clinical presentations of temporal lobe epilepsy (kainic acid model), and occipital cortical epilepsy (tetanus toxin model). The use of chronic models represents a key step in elevating gSGFETs from proof-of-concept chemoconvulsant studies in head-fixed mice, by demonstrating value in both epilepsy research and clinical applications.
-	Association of spatial-coupling between active (pre-ictal) DC-shift and high-gamma power immediately preceding seizure onset, where channels demonstrating both greatest DC-shift amplitude and highest high-gamma power may lead to interictal prediction models of the SOZ with higher specificity.

## Discussion

This thesis contributes towards the study of spatiotemporal relationships in gSGFET recordings from chronic rat models of epilepsy, where wide-bandwidth electrophysiological patterns are poorly understood. Across the three models, including the KA model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), TeNT model of chronic occipital cortical epilepsy (OCE), and PTX model of acute neocortical seizure, we identify distinct morphological, spectral, and spatiotemporal patterns from interictal activity to seizure onset. These include active DC-shifts, infraslow activity (< 0.1 Hz), bursts of high frequency activity, and spike activity with variable amplitudes. The application of gDNPs in the chronic KA model of TLE and TeNT represented a crucial step towards assessing diagnostic value of wide-bandwidth recordings, as these models better resemble spontaneous seizures in the clinic as opposed to chemoconvulsant-induced acute seizures models. Here spatiotemporal signatures were characterised between active DC-shifts and high-frequency activity. The findings highlight limitations in certain models and recording methodologies that hinder the potential of wide-bandwidth electrophysiology for epilepsy research. The unique spatiotemporal characteristics support further investigations of ISA as a predictive biomarker to identify the SOZ with greater specificity in clinical practice.
