# Wide-bandwidth electrographic characterisation of seizures in rat models of epilepsy using graphene micro-transistors
### UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology – MSc Clinical Neuroscience

## Motivation
In this thesis, I demonstrate the value of incorporating infraslow frequency activity (< 0.1 Hz) in seizure onset zone (SOZ) localisation with two rat models of chronic epilepsy (kainic acid and tetanus toxin), and another rat model of acute seizure (picrotoxin); and demonstrate the ability of two-generations of graphene solution-gated field-effect transistors (gSGFETs) in acquiring wide-bandwidth electrophysiological recordings.
Key breakthroughs in this study include:
-	Application of state-of-the-art gSGFETs in chronic models of epilepsy with greater phenotypical overlap with clinical presentations of temporal lobe epilepsy (kainic acid model), and occipital cortical epilepsy (tetanus toxin model). The use of chronic models represents a key step in elevating gSGFETs from proof-of-concept chemoconvulsant studies in head-fixed mice, by demonstrating value in both epilepsy research and clinical applications.
-	Association of spatial-coupling between active (pre-ictal) DC-shift and high-gamma power immediately preceding seizure onset, where channels demonstrating both greatest DC-shift amplitude and highest high-gamma power may lead to interictal prediction models of the SOZ with higher specificity.

The common y-axis corresponds spatially to the 14 channels of gDNP inserted in the visual cortex. We identify a region around channel 11 where with the maximum active (pre-ictal) DC-shift coincided with the maximum normalised high-gamma power (purple).

## Discussion

This thesis contributes towards the study of spatiotemporal relationships in gSGFET recordings from chronic rat models of epilepsy, where wide-bandwidth electrophysiological patterns are poorly understood. Across the three models, including the KA model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), TeNT model of chronic occipital cortical epilepsy (OCE), and PTX model of acute neocortical seizure, we identify distinct morphological, spectral, and spatiotemporal patterns from interictal activity to seizure onset. These include active DC-shifts, infraslow activity (< 0.1 Hz), bursts of high frequency activity, and spike activity with variable amplitudes. The application of gDNPs in the chronic KA model of TLE and TeNT represented a crucial step towards assessing diagnostic value of wide-bandwidth recordings, as these models better resemble spontaneous seizures in the clinic as opposed to chemoconvulsant-induced acute seizures models. Here spatiotemporal signatures were characterised between active DC-shifts and high-frequency activity. The findings highlight limitations in certain models and recording methodologies that hinder the potential of wide-bandwidth electrophysiology for epilepsy research. The unique spatiotemporal characteristics support further investigations of ISA as a predictive biomarker to identify the SOZ with greater specificity in clinical practice.

### Wide-bandwidth electrophysiology adds another dimension to epilepsy research
While previous studies demonstrated temporal correlations between DC-shifts and seizures, this thesis represents the first association between the two along spatiotemporal and power-amplitude domains within the context of SOZ identification in rodent models of chronic epilepsy. Active DC-shifts preceded the onset of ictal high-gamma spikes, while the duration of passive DC-shifts extended beyond observed seizure activity. The amplitude of active (pre-ictal) DC-shift correlated with high-gamma power (50 – 100 Hz) immediately preceding seizure onset across all models. High-gamma activity is commonly used to estimate the SOZ due to its association with hyperexcitable brain regions (Staley, White and Dudek, 2011; Lundstrom et al., 2018). This association is observed across our models where seizure onset was characterised by high-frequency high-amplitude spike activity with dominance in high-gamma power. The increase in gamma power is spatially correlated to the other HFO frequency spectrums including ripple (100 – 250 Hz) and fast-ripple (250 – 500 Hz) activity which have also been postulated to reflect epileptogenic tissue (Worrell et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2009). Notably, in our chronic TeNT model of OCE, a stepwise progression in high-gamma power was observed pre-seizure while ripple and fast-ripple powers remained near-baseline until the penultimate interictal spike. High-gamma oscillations are associated with intraneuronal activity especially during synaptic inhibition and can be modified by pyramidal cells (Hughes, 2008). Thus, the build-up of high-gamma power towards seizure onset could perhaps be explained in part by increased firing of interneurons.
Oscillations and brain signals beyond traditional EEG bands (0.3 – 80 Hz), especially in the ISA band (< 0.1 Hz), are often overlooked but hold great potential as novel electrophysiological biomarkers for SOZ localisation, with added value in establishing other quantifiable parameters to investigate the mechanisms subserving seizure initiation (Jirsa et al., 2014). Chronic implantation of gSGFETs into the somatosensory cortex of a rat model of absence epilepsy previously identified spontaneous spike‐and‐wave discharges (5 – 9 Hz) phase‐coupled to ISA (< 0.1 Hz), suggesting that ISAs could open susceptibility windows for seizure initiation (Bonaccini Calia et al., 2022). Here we demonstrate a negative correlation between the magnitude of normalised ISA power measured at the penultimate interictal spike and proximity to the proposed SOZ. We identify an interesting reversal in ISA power which peaked during the period of high-frequency high-amplitude spike activity that preceded seizure onset, which is the same period with progressive increase in high-gamma power. 
We provide new evidence along the temporal dimension, that ISAs may contribute towards seizure initiation by raising the “baseline” of excitatory activity beyond the tolerance of inhibitory networks, including GABAergic interneurons. The peak in ISA power preceding a seizure could hold the key to the pathophysiology of seizure generation, where the ISA peak coincides with increasing high-gamma power and frequency of spiking. Both excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons likely contribute towards this period of increasing high-gamma power, which then leads to ripple and fast-ripple activity at seizure onset with excellent temporal correlation with tonic-clonic behaviour. The susceptibility window may also modulate the frequency of neuronal firing, as ISA has been postulated to be a surrogate marker for fractional differentiation which is a form of feedback inhibition for single neurons with a variable time window (Lundstrom, 2015; Lundstrom et al., 2018). ISA may thus contribute towards hyperexcitability by increasing neuronal firing frequency and pushing the activity baseline past the tipping point. We believe the back-and-forth between rising and falling normalised ISA power towards seizure onset may suggest the involvement of ISA in a highly variable tug-of-war between hyperexcitability and inhibition states, and would warrant closer examination of ISA spatiotemporal signatures at various timepoints across seizure onset.

### Infraslow activity may help build predictive models of epileptogenic tissue
There remains a need for interictal biomarkers of brain hyperexcitability. In clinical practice, the epileptogenic zone is approximated by recording multiple seizures to estimate the SOZ. However, recording enough seizures to properly localise the SOZ is often difficult and associated with increased time, expense, and patient morbidity (Lundstrom, Brinkmann and Worrell, 2021). Interictal biomarkers predicting, for example, laterality of involvement of specific brain regions would be especially helpful. This study demonstrates that a combination of analytical methods of interictal activity including spike rate, HFO involvement, and wide-bandwidth spectral analysis could provide interictal predictions towards the spatiotemporal signature of seizure activity. 
Interictal high-gamma power was significantly correlated with phases of increased spike frequency and eventual SOZ. We further observed active DC-shifts before seizure onset across multiple channels, with good amplitude-spatial-correlation with normalised high-gamma power. We propose a region of spatial overlap between the greatest active (pre-ictal) DC-shift amplitude and greatest high-gamma power at the penultimate interictal spike. The region of overlap could substantially refine any presumed SOZ determined solely based on high-gamma power, thus increasing specificity in SOZ estimation, and reducing the resection margin. The spatiotemporal signature of ISA differs notably among the interictal baseline, interictal preceding seizure, and periods immediately prior to seizure onset. Further investigation into the susceptibility window theory may prove ISA to be an indispensable biomarker which complements spectral analysis of interictal HFOs towards predictive models of epileptogenic tissue.
